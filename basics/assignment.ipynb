    "\n",
    "Write a funtion which takes two lists as input, make sure that the have the same length (hint: use `assert`) and then adds up the corresponding items. Something like this: `[a, b] + [c, d] = [a+b, c+d]`. (Hint: use `for` loops)\n",

    "\n",
    "The goal is simple. Make a class `Car` with some attributes like name (`str`), number (`int`) and a position (`float`)\n",
    "Then make a few methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `honk()` which prints something\n",
    "2. `move(direction = \"forward\", amount = 0.4)` that updates `self.position` by `amount`\n",
    "3. initiate two different instances of `car`, make them move randomly for 15 steps (use a `for` loop) and then find the distance between them (`car1.position - car2.position`)\n",
    "4. add another custom method of your choice to the class, whatever seems fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "(for both the tasks, use type-hinting wherever you feel it's necessary)"
